# Marketing Plan

Marketing around the Medusa Protocol will be different from the normal marketing around crypto projects. In the crypto market, is common to beg for money without the initial product. \
\
In Medusa Protocol, this will be different. We think like a business, a startup more specifically, and we aim to do our marketing around our MVPs (Minimum Viable Product).

\
At Medusa Protocol, all of our projects converge in terms of publicity. Any big news of any activity, is a form of marketing for us. For example, We bet on going mainstream through the Ocean Cats Cartoon series, betting on getting viral.&#x20;
