# Marketing Plan

Marketing around the Medusa Protocol will be different from the normal marketing around crypto projects.&#x20;

In the crypto market, is common to beg for money without the initial product. \
\
In Medusa Protocol, this will be different. We think like a business, a startup more specifically, and we aim to do our marketing around our MVPs (Minimum Viable Product).

This is different from the common marketing around tokens. On our case, we are promoting our services, targeting mostly users instead of only targeting on investors for the MDUSA token.

Why?&#x20;

MDUSA will grow, naturally, by an inflow of token purchases, through an automatic system of buybacks and burns from all projects inside the ecosystem. The more enthusiasm and use of the products and services, the more MDUSAs are bought and burnt.&#x20;

\
Thanks to our unique tokenomics uniting the projects, at Medusa Protocol, all our projects converge in terms of advertising. Any big news or any deliverable of any activity, is a form of marketing for us.

An example is considering the Ocean Cats: We will launch our pilot episode for the OceanCats Cartoon Series before NFT mint, in order to increase the "hype" around the project and from start go viral.

This is a Medusa powered project, with part of the revenues flowing directly into MDUSA token.
