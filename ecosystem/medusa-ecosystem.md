# Medusa Ecosystem



Medusa Ecosystem follows a strategy of englobing all beneficial creative ideas generated by our team and community and interconnecting them in one big project.

The purpose is to develop several utilities under this ecosystem, some will be direct utilities of the Medusa Project and others will be sub-projects which are co-dependent with the main token of the ecosystem: MDUSA.

The Medusa Ecosystem is a hub of crypto solutions with a good variety to bring power to Medusa Protocol as a whole and, in consequence, to the projects that will enter our ecosystem.
