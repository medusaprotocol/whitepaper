# Medusa Ecosystem

The Medusa Ecosystem is the hub connecting all ideas and services within the Medusa Protocol.

Medusa Ecosystem follows a strategy of englobing all beneficial creative ideas generated by our team and community while interconnecting them, exploring their synergies.&#x20;

\*The main goal is to build an Ecosystem, a Hub for solutions and project buildings inside the crypto market, where the system grows and makes the subprojects grow too as a corollary.\* So, the purpose is to develop several utilities under this ecosystem, with direct and indirect utilities and revenues, connected through the governance and ecosystem token, [MDUSA](../mdusa-token/presenting-mdusa.md).

The Medusa Ecosystem creates and enables a good variety of crypto solutions to bring power to the Medusa Protocol as a whole and, in consequence, to the projects that are inside or will enter our ecosystem.

\*The first projects are to ensure the beginning of the Company with cash flow, differently from most startups. All of them are to bring convergence to Medusa Ecosystem as a whole.\* In the [Project Section](../projects/staking-as-a-service.md), you may find more information regarding the projects under development.&#x20;

\*More projects will come with time as the main features gain more relevance, increasing the revenue of the whole system and bringing more relevance for all of the projects under the umbrella of Medusa Protocol - a virtuous cycle.\* All communities from the different projects will be under the Medusa Ecosystem.
