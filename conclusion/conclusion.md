# Conclusion

Medusa Protocol is founded with a passion for crypto markets and startup environments alongside a desire to make a difference in these scenarios.

The main goal is to build an Ecosystem, a Hub for solutions and project buildings inside the crypto market, where the system grows and makes the subprojects grow too as corollary.

More projects will come with time as the mains features gain traction. The mechanism of easy staking pools is something that investors, like us, would appreciate, and this is one of the mains assets to gain traction in the whole system.

The Medusa is moving fast and in several directions. Everything is thought with careful consideration, to not bring wrong moves for our system. Mistakes will be made for sure, but, avoiding the big ones, these will make the entire project stronger.

This is to have succeeded.”_ \
