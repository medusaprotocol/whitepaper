# Tokenomics

We opt from start with going with a low fee. This will lead to bigger speculation, but also to more volume and holder growth.&#x20;

The MDUSA token has a transfer fee of 5%.&#x20;

3% is allocated for business purposes (marketing, team, structure and other expenditures like that to use as we need);

2% is automatically added to the liquidity pool.

The total supply of MDUSA is 100 000 000 tokens (one hundred million).
