# Presenting MDUSA

MDUSA is a cryptocurrency based on Ethereum blockchain, a ERC-20 token. Our crypto token will have uses for governance and inside Medusa's ecosystem.

From start we envisioned the creation of a token that rewards holders for investing at Medusa Protocol, a crypto venture builder.&#x20;

## Ideals for smart contracts

We had some obstacles to pass to create our Medusa Ecosystem smart contracts. We needed a:

* Blockchain way to reward investors with the projects within Medusa;
* System to benefit our token from other tokens;
* System that increases its liquidity automatically;
* Low tax token, while being able to generate revenues.

With these points in mind, we started to conceptualize the MDUSA token.&#x20;

## Utilities

**Holders of MDUSA get:**

* Exclusive Staking Pools Access;
* Whitelist Access to Medusa Ecosystem Projects;
* Governance Rights;
* Special Uses inside Medusa Ecosystem;
* Access to Medusa Events.

These as just the initial utilities as the team is always thinking of new ways to expand our utility range and harvest the benefits that will come with time for the holders of MDUSA.

## Utility token

The MDUSA Token will be the governance token of the Medusa Protocol Ecosystem.&#x20;

All other tokens from Medusa's sub-projects will be linked to the governance token through fees.
