# Presenting $MDUSA

From start we envisioned the creation of the token that rewards holders for investing at Medusa Protocol, a web3 venture builder.&#x20;

From past experience, we have seen different set of tokenomics that would fit to our project.



We had some problems to solve to create our Medusa Ecosystem smart contracts:

* We needed a blockchain way to reward investors with the projects within Medusa;
* We wanted a system to directly receive from other tokens;
* We wanted a to create a token with auto-liquidity increases;
* We wanted a low tax token, while being able to generate revenues;



With this points in mind, we started to conceptualize the MDUSA token.&#x20;

MDUSA is a Binance Smart Chain Token, the governance and ecosystem token of the Medusa Protocol.&#x20;

****

**Holders of MDUSA get:**

* Share of Revenues;
* Staking Pools Access;
* Whitelist Access to Medusa Ecosystem Projects;
* Governance Rights;
* Access to Medusa Events;

## An utility token



The Medusa Token $MDUSA will be the governance token of the Medusa Protocol Ecosystem. All other tokens from Medusa's sub-projects will be linked to the governance token through fees.
