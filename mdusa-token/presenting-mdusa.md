# Presenting MDUSA

MDUSA is a Binance Smart Chain Token, the governance and ecosystem token of the Medusa Protocol.&#x20;

From start we envisioned the creation of the token that rewards holders for investing at Medusa Protocol, a crypto venture builder.&#x20;

From past experience, we have seen different set of tokenomics that would fit to our project.



We had some problems to solve to create our Medusa Ecosystem smart contracts. We needed a:

* Blockchain way to reward investors with the projects within Medusa;
* System to directly receive from other tokens;
* Token with auto-liquidity increases;
* Low tax token, while being able to generate revenues.



With this points in mind, we started to conceptualize the MDUSA token.&#x20;

## Utilities

**Holders of MDUSA get:**

* Share of Revenues;
* Staking Pools Access;
* Whitelist Access to Medusa Ecosystem Projects;
* Governance Rights;
* Access to Medusa Events.

Also, we are always thinking in more utilities and benefits that will come with time for the holders of MDUSA.

## Utility token

The Medusa Token $MDUSA will be the governance token of the Medusa Protocol Ecosystem. All other tokens from Medusa's sub-projects will be linked to the governance token through fees.
