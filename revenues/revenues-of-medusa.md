# Revenues of Medusa

The medusa ecosystem will feature several revenue streams based on its utilities.&#x20;

In MDUSA Token, we will take part of the transactions as revenue for the company. In a way that this will be sustainable, not harming our entire environment.

You can see the [tokenomics](../mdusa-token/mdusa-tokenomics.md) again if you skipped this part.
{% endhint %}

\
Every sub-project with tokens within our ecosystem will have a 2% transaction fee to go directly to $MDUSA. This will also apply to NFT projects. \
\
From every created staking pool in our platform, we will charge 1% of the allocated tokens for the pool. \
\
Revenues from our own Medusa's NFT sales and our own Medusa's Liquidity Protocol earnings. \
\
A specifically percentage (depending on the activity of the project in question) of the raised funds for sub-projects presales.\
