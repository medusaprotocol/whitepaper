# New Surrealism NFTs

**New Surrealism NFT collection** is a Medusa partnership with creators inside and outside our community. This collection brings a new concept of NFTs, introducing true arts.

The idea is to recreate the surrealism style of art, which, in its time, creates amazing pieces, like the ones by the master Salvador Dalí.
