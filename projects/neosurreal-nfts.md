# NeoSurrealism NFTs

**The NeoSurrealism NFT collection** is a Medusa partnership with artists inside and outside our community. This collection brings a new concept of NFTs, introducing true arts.

The idea is to recreate the surrealism style of art, which, in its time, creates amazing pieces, like the ones by the master Salvador Dalí. But also with uniqueness, we share a link too with Cubism (e.g. Pablo Picasso) and Abstractionism (e.g. Wassily Kandinsky).

Arts, in the traditional investment market, is a good hedge asset and, some of the NFTs are gaining this sentiment. We are creating real arts, in the common sense of the word, in the NFT space. A new style and a new movement. Linking the past Surrealism and movements of art in oil painting with the NeoSurrealism in the digital environment.\

These NFTs, as other projects inside of us, will have benefits that will come along with NFT itself. More details to come.
