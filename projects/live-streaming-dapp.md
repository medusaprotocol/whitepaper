# Live Streaming Dapp

We are creating a Live Stream unique-style platform to connect users and creators. A platform to follow, connect and tip everyone. Where the creator gains the majority of the tips and owns their content.

The Live Streams will be the main service of this App. Always keeping in mind that creators and users are the core, everyone will be respected with low fees in the transaction. But we also will have a place for users to create communities and to interact with themselves.

Games, music and only chat - the Live Streams can be done with a big range of possibilities.

The app will be fully available on iOS, Android, Windows and Linux. More news regarding the App in the future.
