# Live Streaming Dapp

We are creating a Live Stream unique-style platform to connect users and creators. A platform to follow, connect and tip everyone. Where the creator earns through subscriptions, content and merch purchases and even tips.

The Live Streams will be the main service of this App. Always keeping in mind that creators and users are the core, everyone will be respected with low fees in the transactions. A place not only designed for media content but also for users to create communities and interact with each other.

Games, music, chat and so much more - the Live Streams can be done with a big range of possibilities.

The app will be fully available on iOS, Android, Windows and Linux. More news regarding the App in the future.
