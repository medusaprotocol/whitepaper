# ICO

An Initial Coin Offering (ICO) is a process to give access for a cryptocurrency to the public, which investors can buy and sell on public platforms, such as Exchanges and DEXs (Decentralized Exchanges). Is a process analogous to an Initial Public Offering, where companies sell their stocks publicly.

In our case, our ICO is a key event to gather funds and increase our community to develop Medusa Protocol.

## Fair Launch

We will do a first pre-sale only with selected people through a whitelist in PinkSale.&#x20;

Fair Launch is the best for us in the current scenario of a bear market. We will gather the resources necessary to improve our services and to get to another step in the Company, which includes aggressive marketing, new services, and finishing the old projects.

## Finishing the Process

After a not-determined period of time, we will start an ICO process launching at the principalsâ€™ DEX and Exchanges.

To know more details about our pre-sale process contact us at our [telegram community](https://t.me/medusaprotocol) or through **team@medusaprotocol.com.**
