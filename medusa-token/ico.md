# ICO

An Initial Coin Offering (ICO) is a process to give access for a cryptocurrency to the public, which investors can buy and sell on public platforms, such as Exchanges and DEXs (Decentralized Exchanges). Is a process analogous to an Initial Public Offering, where companies sell their stocks publicly.

In our case, our ICO is a key event to gather funds and increase our community to develop Medusa Protocol.

## The Process

We will do a first pre-sale only with selected people through a whitelist in PinkSale, then a launch at the principalsâ€™ DEX in the current scenario and after in the big Exchanges.

To know more details about our pre-sale process contact us at our [telegram community](https://t.me/medusaprotocol) or through **team@medusaprotocol.com.**
