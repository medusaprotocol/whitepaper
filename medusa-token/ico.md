# ICO

An Initial Coin Offering (ICO) is a process to give access for a cryptocurrency to the public, which investors can buy and sell on public platforms, such as Exchanges and DEXs (Decentralized Exchanges). Is a process analogous to an Initial Public Offering, where companies sell their stocks publicly.

In our case, our ICO is a key event to gather funds and increase our community to develop Medusa Protocol.
