# What we envision

## The Medusa Vision

**Medusa Protocol is built with the future always in mind.** A startup seeking to disrupt the environment with completely unique solutions and creations.&#x20;

We have a different vision for crypto. We see it as the medium to build a community of supporters around a project. The medium to generate revenues to compensate the investors directly though sales and revenues from our services.&#x20;



MDUSA is a different type of crypto asset. A utility-powered crypto token relying less on market volatility, and more on the services the startup provides.&#x20;



**We started with our big dream of building the Medusa Live Streaming Dapp. Something completely unique on the world.** A decentralized platform for everyone to easy monetize their content. A place where creators are well compensated and the platform doesn't keep huge percentages of their earnings. A platform powered by the Medusa Community.&#x20;



After significant analysis, we figured out it would be a mistake to launch a live streaming dapp without a big community of hundreds of thousands of supporters behind it. The competition on the social media field is huge, and a platform with only a few users is a guaranteed failure.&#x20;



For months we reflected on how to grow our startup into something people would be curious upon. We rebranded, improved a lot and worked on conceptualizing a clear path to reach our goals. And in the meantime, new ideas popped in our heads.&#x20;



First we thought on Celestia.&#x20;



Then the OceanCats.&#x20;



Then our unique easy-staking protocol.



And from it, we created a whole ecosystem of projects powered by our startup, a Web3 venture builder developing a whole range of services and projects.



We started to work on these projects and started to release new information. People from different fields within crypto were getting interested. From the fans of NFTs, to the fans of DeFi tokens, Medusa Protocol is capitalizing this diversity and using it as path to grow our community as a whole.



We wanted to ensure that investors of MDUSA token are awarded by betting at our success, so we  created a set of smart contracts with direct connection among our blockchain projects, ensuring that all projects within the ecosystem are connected through the MDUSA token.



So today we define us as a web3 venture builder betting on disruptive opportunities on the DeFi space. Always growing our protocol with different services and operations to ensure a diverse range of revenues flowing into the project.



Everyone at the Medusa Protocol team is aware of the big challenges we are proposing and are very confident at our capabilities to deliver.
