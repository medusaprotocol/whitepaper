# NFT Market Analysis

NFTs, non-fungible tokens, are a disruptive way to store data on a digital ledger through the blockchain.

Differently from a fungible token, such as Bitcoin or the MDUSA token, NFTs are unique, where one NFT is different from another.&#x20;

Arts, tickets, videos and photos are examples of NFTs, but they can be much more. The imagination is the limit.

Why do they have value? Value has a subjective side. If you imagine a painting, some people can place a high value on it  and some don't.

With NFTs, you can prove you have something unique that others don't. NFTs are also part of the history of the cryptomarket through the blockchain.

Considering only the biggest NFT marketplaces, the market cap of this section had already more than[ 19 billion USD and moved around 250 million USD each day](https://coinmarketcap.com/nft/). A new market with limitless possibilities.
